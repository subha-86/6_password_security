#  Password Strength Evaluation Activity

## Objective
The objective of this activity is to understand the principles of strong password creation by testing a variety of passwords with different complexities using a trusted password strength evaluation tool. This exercise highlights how character variety, randomness, and length contribute to password security and resilience against cyber-attacks.

##  Tools Used

### [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com)
A comprehensive password strength checker that evaluates passwords based on multiple factors such as length, use of uppercase/lowercase characters, numbers, symbols, sequential patterns, and more. It provides a score, visual feedback, and recommendations to improve password strength.

## ðŸ“Š Passwords Tested and Results

| Password                 | Score/Strength | Feedback Summary                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hello123`               | Very Weak      | Short, lacks symbols and uppercase, predictable pattern                         |
| `HelloWorld2025`         | Moderate       | Includes uppercase and numbers, but lacks symbols and randomness                |
| `P@ssw0rd!`              | Weak           | Commonly used substitutions, predictable and easily guessed                     |
| `G7!dR#q2Xm`             | Strong         | Randomized, includes all character types, high entropy                          |
| `My$ecureP@ssw0rd2025!`  | Very Strong    | Long, includes uppercase/lowercase, numbers, multiple symbols, excellent randomness |

## Key Learnings

- **Length Matters**: Longer passwords are exponentially more secure.
- **Character Variety is Essential**: Using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols greatly enhances strength.
- **Avoid Predictable Patterns**: Substitutions like "@" for "a" or "0" for "o" are no longer secure.
- **Randomness Beats Familiarity**: Unstructured, unique strings are far harder to crack than recognizable words or phrases.
- **Common Phrases are Dangerous**: Even complex-looking passwords can be weak if they are commonly used or follow a known pattern.

##  Common Password Attack Methods
### 1. **Brute Force Attack**
Tries every possible combination of characters. Easily breaks short or simple passwords.
### 2. **Dictionary Attack**
Attempts passwords based on a precompiled list of common words or leaked passwords.
### 3. **Credential Stuffing**
Uses credentials obtained from data breaches to access other accounts using reused passwords.

## Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

- Use **at least 12â€“16 characters**.
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols**.
- Avoid **real words**, **names**, or **birthdays**.
- Do **not reuse passwords** across multiple sites.
- Consider using a **password manager** to store and generate secure passwords.

##  Deliverables

-  A detailed report of password tests and their results (see above).
-  Summary of best practices and feedback from PasswordMeter.
-  Documentation of research on password attacks and security principles.

## Conclusion

This activity demonstrates the importance of password complexity and uniqueness in modern cybersecurity. Using a tool like PasswordMeter helps visualize how small changes in password structure can dramatically improve defense against attacks. By applying best practices, users can significantly reduce their vulnerability to password breaches.
